** The NXP SPICE model argument order and naming is odd.
** This tries to make both sane. Or at least sanER. The
** pins are in the SOT-23 package order with sane names:
** 1 - Gate, 2 - Source, 3 - Drain
**
** For some reason the SPICE model is DGS. Maybe that's
** some standard transistor pin order? That would be the
** first time there's a standard for it.
**
** I would love to just include the whole SPICE file,
** but it's (C) Transim. Go download it from 
**
**   https://www.nexperia.com/product/PMV250EPEA
**
** and put it under this repo in a "sim" directory
